This is the original source code of SYMASS, a PAL compatible 2-pass
assembler for the Commdore 64. SYMASS was written by Robert Huehn and
published in the Canadian Transactor magazine.

I have only made very minor changes to get the code to assemble with
TMPx or 64tass: stripping the BASIC line numbers, splitting lines
containing multiple statements, etc. The original, unmodified source
is preserved on the included disk image (SYMASS can assemble itself).
