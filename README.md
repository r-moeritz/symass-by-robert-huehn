This is the original source code of SYMASS, a PAL compatible 2-pass assembler
for the Commdore 64. SYMASS was written by Robert Huehn and published in the
Canadian Transactor magazine.

I have stripped the line numbers from the original source code, split lines
containing multiple statements separated by colons, and made a few other minor
changes to get the code to assemble with [TMPx](https://style64.org/release/tmpx-v1.1.0-style).
